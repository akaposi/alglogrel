First reviewer:
  - "add reference to H-S grpd model" -- why?
  - consider a listing environment for 2.2 (external TT) to improve
    readability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response to the first reviewer:

- Extending to n-Type:
  As we note in section 2, generalizing external types in signatures to Type-i
  is possible and not difficult. We omit this generalization from the paper
  mainly in order to sync with the existing Agda formalization.

  TODO

- Lambdas in signatures:

  Such lambdas can be always eliminated by introducing extra function
  parameters which are constrained by pointwise equalities.  In the
  case of the mentioned example,

    z : H
    n : (A → H) → H
    q : n (λ x. z) = z

  We may have the following equivalent λ-free type for q:

    q : (f : A → H) → ((x : A) → f x = z) → n f = z

  In general, if we have
    Γ;Δ ⊢ λx. t : El ((x : a) → b)
  Then instead we may have
    Γ;Δ, f : El ((x : a) → b), p : (x : a) → f x = t ⊢ f : El ((x : a) → b)

  We include this explanation in the revision.

- Page 7, 8 item (5), about type equalities and UA

  We include this in the revision.
  (TODO: look at what I added to the paper, maybe we can say more)

- Page 10, about initial NatAlg

- Page 11, about coherence issue, references

  In the revision we add a reference to the following discussion:

    https://homotopytypetheory.org/2014/03/03/hott-should-eat-itself/

  As discussed there, our coherence problem is related to the better
  known problem of constructing semisimplicial types; solving the
  former implies a solution of the latter.

  TODO

- Page 13, "would merely decidable equality also be sufficient?"

  For the purpose of elaborating raw syntax into intrinsic syntax
  (which is in our view a primary motivation for decidability), it
  would not be sufficient, because we need to eliminate from decided
  equalities to proof-relevant intrinsic terms.

Response to the second reviewer:

- On the suggestion for identity homomorphisms:

  This suggestion does solve the U[] case. However, it still does not
  work; some cases (like U[]) become provable, where we can make use
  of strict equality hypotheses, but other cases fail, where we need
  to provide strict equalities. For example, assuming the suggested
  strict tᴵᴰ equations, we have

    (t =ₐ u)ᴵᴰ γ : (t = u)ᴹ γ γ (Γᴵᴰ γ) ≡ Uᴵᴰ γ ((t = u)ᴬ γ)

  The type can be reduced along definitions, and using tᴵᴰ and uᴵᴰ, to:

    (λ e. refl ◾ ap (λ x. x) e ◾ refl) ≡ (λ e. e)

  Here, e : tᴬ γ = uᴬ γ, and it is necessarily a non-strict equality. Hence,
  this case is not provable with strict tᴵᴰ equalities but provable with weak
  ones. We include this explanation in the revision.

- Addressing comments:
  - page 7, Figure 2, about external parameters:

    We are not completely sure about the question, but anyway we include some
    comments on the external context here.

    The codomain types of external (6) and infinitary (7) functions can depend
    on the additional (x : A) external binder. For example, if we have Γ = Nat:
    Type₀, zero: Nat, suc: Nat → Nat, and we write the signature for
    length-indexed A-vectors, then we have "cons : (n : Nat) → A → Vec n → Vec
    (suc n)", where the "suc n" expression refers back to the external "n : Nat"
    binder. The only way to extend the external Γ is by using (6) and (7)
    functions, otherwise, we can only refer to Γ entries which are assumed on
    the "top level", such as the A : Type₀ in the example for lists on page 8
    in Section 2.1.

  - page 12: for the intrinsic syntax, do you also assume an induction
    principle for it, e.g. that it is initial?

    Yes. Of course, the induction principle for the intrinsic syntax would be
    something that is formalized in the current paper, so if we want to avoid
    circularity, then we need to say that the induction principle is given in an
    ad-hoc fashion. This is probably acceptable, since such ad-hoc HIT induction
    principles have been common in previous HoTT literature.

  - page 12, line -9: you say that you "need to" set-truncate; is this
    rather a strong belief that you have to?

    On the next page we justify the need for truncation. We think that
    undecidability of conversion and impossibility of extrinsic term
    models are solid justifications.

  - page 21, line -16: is there an expected equation if all computation rules
    were definitional?

    We think that if we follow "book" HoTT practice, p^s would be a
    propositional computation rule, because it involves "coe" which is defined
    externally, similarly to how path constructor computation rules involving
    "ap" are also propositional.
